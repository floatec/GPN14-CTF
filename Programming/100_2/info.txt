
Programming 100 - weird garbage
=================================

Description
------------
weird garbage: We found an enemy server with an open socket. When connecting we only get strange Symbols, maybe you can decrypt them.



Steps
-------
Connect to the Server and get several Strings which are brainfuck code which needs to be interpreted.
Then you will get three chars of the Flag. If you have enough parts you can reassemble the Flag


Solution
----------
sqrts{16f3a102e8cb187da3662be549e417a7}


Possible hints
---------------
1. The garbage looks always similar, maybe it is code
2. Try to combine the garbage
